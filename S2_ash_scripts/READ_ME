GoPro script notes

Text documents in Unix (LF) format encoded Unicode UTF-8 saved as <autoexec.ash> work to hack GoPros.

When copied and pasted onto a GoPro model HERO3 Black cameraâ€™s SD card, scripts in this folder interrupt the startup protocol and execute a function.  

To modify scripts, use a simple text editor such as Sublime Text or Text Wrangler.

If script doesn't work:
	check syntax
	upload to http://www.cam-do.com/SOBM/ and check for CR characters
	delete pseudocode
	build script incrementally from working lines of code
